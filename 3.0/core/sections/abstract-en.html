<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The REC core module collects the top-level classes and properties that span over or are reused within multiple REC modules.

Note that this module reuses certain classes, properties, and named individuals from other vocabularies, e.g., GeoSPARQL; the copyright conditions on those reused entities are stated in their respective rdfs:comments annotations.</span>
