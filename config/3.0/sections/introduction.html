<h2 class="list">Introduction</h2>

<p>
  RealEstateCore is a common language to enable control over buildings and development of new services - a facilitator of the promises of a digital transformation and buildings' integration with the Smart City.<br>
</p>

<h3 class="list">Why do we need RealEstateCore?</h3>
<p>
  Ever increasing amounts of data are generated by and within buildings. Several different legacy systems exist to control climate, lighting, access control, etc. plus all the new data sources that emerge from IoT devices. These large amounts of
  heterogeneous data need to be organized in order to be able to contribute to cost-efficient and environmentally friendly real estate management.
</p>
<p>
  We use Semantic Web technologies combined with a property-owner-business-usefulness-approach; the result is the RealEstateCore (REC) ontology.
</p>
<p>
  A consortium was formed 2017 with Vasakronan AB, Akademiska Hus AB, Klipsk AB, and Willhem AB as the founders and main sponsors of the RealEstateCore project. The purpose of the consortium is to create an environment for cooperation and sharing of
  knowledge between property owners and partners.

  <strong>RealEstateCore is made by and for property owners.</strong>

<h3 class="list">Modules to make it customizable</h3>
<p>
  RealEstateCore consists of a set of modules, which in the current version include:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://w3id.org/rec/metadata/3.0">Metadata</a></dt>
  <dd>Various annotation properties used to document the entire ontology suite.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://w3id.org/rec/core/3.0/">Core</a></dt>
  <dd>collects the top-level classes and properties that span over or are reused within multiple REC modules. Imports the Metadata module, and is imported by all other specific child modules.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://w3id.org/rec/agents/3.0/">Agents</a></dt>
  <dd>Basic types of agents (people, organizations, groups), structurally aligned with FOAF.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://w3id.org/rec/building/3.0/">Building</a></dt>
  <dd>Different types of building components and rooms.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://w3id.org/rec/device/3.0/">Device</a></dt>
  <dd>Device types (sensors and actuators), device configuration, device actuation, etc.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://w3id.org/rec/lease/3.0/">Lease</a></dt>
  <dd>Contracts, leasable premises, types of premises, etc.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
  The purpose of using different modules to model domain-specific details is to facilitate customization for each user, e.g. a fictitious RetailPropertyOwner might use the Core and Device modules just as they are, but might want to modify the
  Building module to reflect the type of business that they do (e.g., by providing a more suitable taxonomy of room types for retail real estate).<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Core module is an upper ontology supporting the more specific modules that model domain specific details. This structure makes it easy to in the future add more domain ontologies to expand the usefulness of the RealEstateCore.<br>
